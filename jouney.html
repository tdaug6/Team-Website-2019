      <h2>Part 1 - <i>Lego League</i></h2>
      <p>Our story starts in 2016 with our school's FIRST LEGO League team.
         We were Robotics Rex from Camp Ernst Middle School.
         This team was our first exposure to any kind of competitve robotics program.
         We were an enthusiastic team that just wanted to go out there and have some fun!
         We worked hard in and out of school.
         The other LEGO team at our school was much more established with members that had years of experience in the program.
         They helped us understand the challenge and what needed to be done for that challenge.
      </p>
      <p>At our first competition, we were all very nervous.
        We sang Taylor Swift songs to ease the tension a little.
        Our presentation consisted of Ninja Turtles talking about pollution.
        Everyone remembered their script and performed extremely well.
        In our robot interview, we discussed the missions we chose and how we programmed them to work.
        We did not fully prepare for this, but it went better than we expected.
        We were so thankful for how the beginning of our day was going.
      </p>
      <p>We were ecstatic about how the day was going!
        We were walking confidently down the hall when one of our teammembers dropped our LEGO basket.
        This LEGO brick basket was a key part in our highest scoring mission, and there it was on the ground.
        In pieces.
        The mood immediately shifted to panic.
        How would we fix this?
        How could we still compete in the robot runs?
      </p>
      <p>We collected ourselves and put our heads together to find a fix for this huge problem.
        We pulled out our spare LEGO parts that were meant to be a backup for the robot.
        We were determined to make a stronger, less breakable basket.
        We figured out the dimensions based on the limited materials of the broken basket and put together a new one.
        We ran our original program with our new basket on our practice run.
        To our surprise . . . it worked!
      </p>
      <p>After this incident, nothing in the world could phase us.
        The rest of our day ran very smoothly.
        Our robot runs worked almost perfectly!
        Our school's other team was doing amazing.
        Overall, it was a great competition day.
        We ended higher up on the scoreboard than we could have ever hoped!
      </p>
      <p>While waiting for the awards ceremony to start, a new kind of robot rolled into the gym.
        This robot was huge and much more complex than the tiny ones that we had been programming.
        It moved in all directions without changine the way it was facing.
        It was made almost entirely out of metal, and what wasn't metal was custom plastic parts.
        This robot captured everyone's attention.
        It was FIRST Robotics Competition team 3814 PiBotics.
        What they were doing was spectacular and we knew that this was something that we wanted to work towards.
      </p>
      <p>After being dazzled by the magnificent machine, it was finally time for awards.
        We had no expectation of getting one, but we were waiting to see if we made an unexpected impact on the judges.
        We sat on the edge of our seat each time an award was introduced and deflated a little when it did not go to our team.
        Only to find ourselves back on the edge of our seats when the next award was brought up.
        This painstaking cycle of hoping then collapsing then hoping then collapsing lasted the entire awards ceremony.
        When the last award was introduced, we wished so hard it would be given to us.
        When it was granted to a different team, we were slightly disappointed, but not surprised.
      </p>
      <p>Our hope was renewed when the announcer surprised us with revealing the teams that would be attending states that year.
        We listened to the list waiting for us or the other Camp Ernst team to be called.
        We were listening so intently we almost didn't hear the words "Robotics Rex" announced.
        We were so happy that the judges selected us to attend such a highly competitive competition.
        We sat in elation hoping for our sister team's name to be called as well.
        However, when the end of the list came, the Trailblazers were not called.
        Could we have missed their name during our celebration?
        Unfortunately, however, their name was not called.
        We were so thankful for the opportunity that was granted to us, 
        but surprised at the same time that a more experienced team was not given the same.
      </p>
      <p>We were determined to represent our school well at States.
        We worked even harder than before.
        We put in more time outside of school.
        Christmas break came around and we were up all hours of the night working to get our program just right.
        We used every minute of our practice time working to get our robot functional.
        By the time States came around, we were confident that our robot would perform the way it was designed to.
      </p>
      <p>We walked into the competition feeling excited about the day to come.
        We walked into the presentation room and gave our skit of Ninja Turtles talking about pollution.
        It went better than the last time.
        We knew that day was going to be a good day!
        We entered the robot interview room much more prepared than the last time.
        It went much better than the one at regionals.
        We had a feeling today was going to be a great day!
        So far, there were no unnecessary accidents or nervous feelings.
        Everything was going to plan.
        Next was the robot runs.
        These went well, but not as good as the last time.
        We were further down on the leader board, but still up there.
        The day went extremely well.
        High above our expectations that we set at the beginning of the season.
      </p>
      <p>Award time came for the State competition.
        We waited in anticipation yet again for "Robotics Rex" to be called.
        It never came.
        We did not get an award and we were not on the list to go to Worlds.
        We were so thankful the opportunity that was given to us by the judges at Regionals.
      </p>
      <p>We did not want to stop here with this disappoinment at states.
        We wanted to go further in the engineering pathway.
        However, we did not want to be playing with LEGOs anymore.
        We wanted something bigger, similar to what we saw with PiBotics.
        We were ready to move on to the next stage of our robotics career.
