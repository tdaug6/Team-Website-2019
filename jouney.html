      <h2>Part 1 - <i>Lego League</i></h2>
      <p>Our story starts in 2016 with our school's FIRST LEGO League team.
         We were Robotics Rex from Camp Ernst Middle School.
         This team was our first exposure to any kind of competitve robotics program.
         We were an enthusiastic team that just wanted to go out there and have some fun!
         We worked hard in and out of school.
         The other LEGO team at our school was much more established with members that had years of experience in the program.
         They helped us understand the challenge and what needed to be done for that challenge.
      </p>
      <p>At our first competition, we were all very nervous.
        We sang Taylor Swift songs to ease the tension a little.
        Our presentation consisted of Ninja Turtles talking about pollution.
        Everyone remembered their script and performed extremely well.
        In our robot interview, we discussed the missions we chose and how we programmed them to work.
        We did not fully prepare for this, but it went better than we expected.
        We were so thankful for how the beginning of our day was going.
      </p>
      <p>We were ecstatic about how the day was going!
        We were walking confidently down the hall when one of our teammembers dropped our LEGO basket.
        This LEGO brick basket was a key part in our highest scoring mission, and there it was on the ground.
        In pieces.
        The mood immediately shifted to panic.
        How would we fix this?
        How could we still compete in the robot runs?
      </p>
      <p>We collected ourselves and put our heads together to find a fix for this huge problem.
        We pulled out our spare LEGO parts that were meant to be a backup for the robot.
        We were determined to make a stronger, less breakable basket.
        We figured out the dimensions based on the limited materials of the broken basket and put together a new one.
        We ran our original program with our new basket on our practice run.
        To our surprise . . . it worked!
      </p>
      <p>After this incident, nothing in the world could phase us.
        The rest of our day ran very smoothly.
        Our robot runs worked almost perfectly!
        Our school's other team was doing amazing.
        Overall, it was a great competition day.
        We ended higher up on the scoreboard than we could have ever hoped!
      </p>
      <p>While waiting for the awards ceremony to start, a new kind of robot rolled into the gym.</p>
